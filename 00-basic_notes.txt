JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language based on the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript can run in both browser environments (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and server environments (like Node.js).
    JS is typically used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and handle user interactions.
JavaScript was traditionally interpreted line by line.
    But modern engines like V8 in Chrome and Node.js use a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
    JS is not purely compiled or purely interpreted.
    JIT compiler prepare a byte of the written program and that byte code is interpreted line-by-line.
    If JS would have been a purely interpreted language it would have atleast printed Hello according the code below, but that won't be the case.
        Program 1: doesn't even executes even the first correct line of code.
            console.log("Hello");   --> correct line
            function fun() {        --> correct line
                console..log(1)     --> incorrect line
                return 0;           --> correct line
            }                       --> correct line
            console...log("world"); --> incorrect line
            console.log("END")      --> correct line
        Program 2: logs the string 'hi' and then throws the error.
            console.log("hi");      --> correct line
            console.lo("bye");      --> incorrect line
You can source a JS file in a HTML documument
    <body>
        <scrit src = "app.js"></script>
    </body>
